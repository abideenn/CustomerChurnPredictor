# Customer Churn Predictor
> [Link to Churn Predictor](https://churnpredictorzain.herokuapp.com/)

Customer churn is the percentage of customers your business lost in a set period of time. For instance, if you had 100 customers at the beginning of the month, and lost 
10 of them throughout the month, you had a 10% churn rate for the month.

In this project, I have addressed the problem of churning of customers. I have aggregated data of a Telecommunication company and applied EDA on the data. After 
understanding the data, I have applied many classification models on it like decision tree classifier, random forest, xgboost, logistic regression, LGBM, SVM, 
adaboost, neurel network, Naive Bayes and random forest after PCA.

The results were:

After that I made a Flask api which takes all the parameters and returns the result back. I deployed the project on Heroku.

I have also made a Power BI report to better understand and visualize the data.
